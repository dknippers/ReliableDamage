Makes weapon damage as reliable as possible.

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Every shot has a 100% hit chance, but lowered damage so the expected value of the shot is unchanged.
[*] Weapon spread is removed (can be reverted in Config\XComGameData_WeaponData.ini)
[*] Critical damage / Graze shots are removed but their effects are incorporated in every shot instead (i.e., 25% chance to crit for an additional 4 damage would simply do +1 damage on each shot instead). This is configurable, both types of shots can be restored to normal if desired.
[*] Abilities like Viper's Bind can still miss (as for example the pull effect would be heavily OP with 100%)

[*] The aim is to have the expected value (chance * dmg) be the damage applied on every shot.
[*] Example; a 4 dmg shot with a 50% chance to hit will now have a 100% chance to do 2 damage.

[*] When <hit_chance> * <weapon_damage> is a fractional number, we will roll for the final integer value to deal as damage, with appropriate probabilities.
[*] Example: a 4 dmg shot with a 60% chance to hit means the expected value would be 4 * 0.6 = 2.4. We convert this to a 60% chance of 2 damage and a 40% chance of 3 and will roll for the resulting value.

[*] The shot HUD is adjusted to display the "expected value" of the shot, which can be a fractional number.
[*] Example; when the shot HUD display "3.25", it means there is a 75% chance to do 3 damage and a 25% chance to do 4 damage.

[*] For more information on implementation details look through the source, I commented as much as I could.
[*] Log entries for every shot are written to the Launch.log file, with information on how exactly the damage of a shot was calculated (can be found in <USER_FOLDER>\Documents\My Games\XCOM2\XComGame\Logs\, CTRL+F for "ReliableDamage").
